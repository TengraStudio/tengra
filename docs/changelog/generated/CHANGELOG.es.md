**Resumen**: Refactoricé con éxito el sistema MCP (Protocolo de contexto modelo), extrayendo herramientas internas en una arquitectura de servidor modular. Esto mejora la capacidad de mantenimiento, reduce el tamaño del archivo del registro y prepara el sistema para futuras expansiones de complementos.
### Logros clave
1. **Arquitectura de servidor modular**:
- Se extrajeron más de 20 herramientas internas de un `registry.ts` monolítico en módulos de servidor especializados:
- `core.server.ts`: Sistema de archivos, ejecución de comandos e información del sistema.
- `network.server.ts`: Búsqueda web, SSH y utilidades de red.
- `utility.server.ts`: Capturas de pantalla, notificaciones, seguimiento y portapapeles.
- `project.server.ts`: Git, Docker y escaneo de proyectos.
- `data.server.ts`: Base de datos, incrustaciones y utilidades Ollama.
- `security.server.ts`: Ayudantes de seguridad y auditoría de red.
- Se implementó `server-utils.ts` para tipos compartidos, normalización de resultados y barreras de seguridad.
2. **Pelusa y mantenimiento**:
- Se redujo aún más el recuento de advertencias globales de **655** a **468**.
- Se resolvió todos los problemas de clasificación de importaciones en los nuevos módulos MCP.
- Legibilidad de código mejorada al mover lógica de dominio distinta a archivos separados y enfocados.
3. **Actualización de documentación y hoja de ruta**:

### Corrección de errores del sistema de proyectos

- **Type**: fix
- **Status**: unknown
- **Summary**: Las correcciones de errores del sistema de proyectos fortalecieron la confiabilidad y la seguridad al abordar problemas conocidos y reforzar las rutas críticas.

**Estado**: Problemas críticos solucionados
**Problemas resueltos**:
#### **Error n.º 1: los enlaces de la barra lateral desaparecen** ✅
- **Problema**: cuando el usuario seleccionó un proyecto, toda la barra lateral desapareció, lo que impidió la navegación hacia otras vistas.
- **Causa raíz**: la representación condicional en App.tsx ocultó completamente la barra lateral cuando `currentView === 'projects' && selectedProject`
- **Solución**: Se eliminó la lógica condicional: la barra lateral ahora siempre está visible, lo que permite a los usuarios navegar entre vistas incluso mientras se encuentran en el espacio de trabajo del proyecto.
- **Archivo**: `src/renderer/App.tsx` - Lógica de representación de la barra lateral simplificada
#### **Error nº2: Error de dimensión vectorial en Code Intelligence** ✅
- **Problema**: el análisis del proyecto falló con el error "el vector debe tener al menos 1 dimensión" durante la indexación del código
- **Causa raíz**: al incrustar el proveedor establecido en 'ninguno', el servicio devolvió una matriz vacía `[]` que la base de datos rechazó (el tipo de vector PostgreSQL requiere 1+ dimensiones)
- **Solución**: Devuelve el vector cero de 384 dimensiones `new Array(384).fill(0)` en lugar de una matriz vacía para el proveedor "ninguno"
- **Archivo**: `src/main/services/llm/embedding.service.ts` - Se reemplazó la matriz vacía con el vector predeterminado adecuado
- **Adicional**: Se corrigió el código inalcanzable (declaración de devolución duplicada) en getCurrentProvider()
**Detalles técnicos**:
- **Solución de la barra lateral**: los usuarios ahora pueden acceder a todas las opciones de navegación mientras ven proyectos, manteniendo UX consistente
- **Corrección de vectores**: la indexación de inteligencia de código funcionará con el proveedor de incrustación "ninguno" utilizando cero vectores, lo que evitará violaciones de las restricciones de la base de datos.
- **Compatibilidad de bases de datos**: los vectores cero mantienen las dimensiones adecuadas para las operaciones vectoriales de PostgreSQL y no indican ningún significado semántico.
**Archivos modificados**:
- `src/renderer/App.tsx` - Se eliminó la representación problemática de la barra lateral condicional
- `src/main/services/llm/embedding.service.ts` - Se solucionó el problema de dimensión vectorial y el código inalcanzable
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Se agregó documentación de corrección
**Estado de la prueba**: TypeScript compilación exitosa, no se encontraron errores de tipo
**Impacto en el usuario**:
- La navegación del proyecto ahora funciona correctamente sin perder el acceso a la barra lateral
- El análisis/indexación del código se completará exitosamente independientemente de la elección del proveedor de integración.
- Mejora de la confiabilidad y experiencia del usuario en el flujo de trabajo de gestión de proyectos.
